        <h2>1. We Respect Your Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Your notes are yours. We don't peek — unless your note says "Delete me after reading" —
            in that case, we obey.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Creepy Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We don't track your IP like a hawk. We only store what's needed to deliver your note —
            kind of like your nosy neighbor who just waves politely.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Custom Codes</h2>
        <p>
            You can choose your own code for your notes. Just don't pick "1234" — that's boring.
            And yes, we'll tell you if your custom code is already taken 😂.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Self-Destructing Notes</h2>
        <p>
            If you tick "Delete after view", we will self-destruct the note like a mini-movie explosion.
            Refreshing the page means it's gone.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We don't use cookies for spying — only the ones necessary to keep your session alive.
            Feel free to dunk them in milk 🍪.
