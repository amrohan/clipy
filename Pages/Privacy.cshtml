        <h2>1. We Respect Your Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Your notes are yours. We don't peek — unless your note says "Delete me after reading" —
            in that case, we obey.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Creepy Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We don't track your IP like a hawk. We only store what's needed to deliver your note —
            kind of like your nosy neighbor who just waves politely.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Custom Codes</h2>
        <p>
            You can choose your own code for your notes. Just don't pick "1234" — that's boring.
            And yes, we'll tell you if your custom code is already taken 😂.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Self-Destructing Notes</h2>
        <p>
            If you tick "Delete after view", we will self-destruct the note like a mini-movie explosion.
            Refreshing the page means it's gone.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Encryption</h2>
        <p>
            All notes are encrypted at rest using strong AES-256 encryption. This means that even if someone
            got access to the database, your note content would still look like unreadable gibberish.
            You can also use your own custom encryption key for extra privacy — we never see it.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We don't use cookies feel free to dunk them in milk 🍪.
